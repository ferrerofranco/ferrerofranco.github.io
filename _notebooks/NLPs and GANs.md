# How it started
Through a friend of mine I recently came across a [couple](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J7KhWkyRpyMkREwIgk8cwi89JiyJ6Yjl?usp=sharing) of [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing) posted by [@advadnoun](https://twitter.com/advadnoun) in which he used [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) with both [BigGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096) and [SIREN](https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/) to create images with a user input phrase.  
After having some fun with it and trying to make my friends guess what the picture represented I thought  *well... there are plenty of models that do the inverse, right? You input an image and they try to describe it* (it's called "Image captioning"). *We could input a phrase, translate it into an image, and then translate it back and see what we get. Kind of like between different languages but with images.* 

That sounded cool to me, so I did it.  
  
While in the process I also thought of a second question *would the image caption part of the pipeline understand real life images of that original input phrase better than the ones generated by another network?*  
We'll see!  

# How it went
I worked with two models. The first one uses VGG16 and the second one uses Xception as a photo feature extractor, and they both use RNN and a FF layers as sequence processor and decoding respectively. Here are the links to the notebooks on the [former](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CEVUmu8giZuoNc7Qy17cvLcIK9m4ddFA?usp=sharing) and the [latter](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16kWT9I57T8ZkEeJ5RCFjUa7dFqgusYuY?usp=sharing).s
  
After training them they were both subjected to a [BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) score analysis, here are the scores:  

| BLEU-n | VGG16 | Xception |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| BLEU-1 | 0.558444 | 0.347332 |
| BLEU-2 | 0.299974 | 0.189991 |
| BLEU-3 | 0.197463 | 0.130232 |
| BLEU-4 | 0.086908 | 0.055207 |  

According to Jason Brownlee, as a reference, these are ballpark BLEU scores for a decent model:

BLEU-1: **0.401** to **0.578**.  
BLEU-2: **0.176** to **0.390**.  
BLEU-3: **0.099** to **0.260**.  
BLEU-4: **0.059** to **0.170**.  

As you can see, the VGG model seems to be on the upper spectrum of the reference scores, while the Xception model is on the lower, directly failing the BLEU-1 score.

Now for the results of the experiment! (I haven't uploaded the notebook that runs both models at the same time and gets the BLEU scores, but I might if requested).  
Note: Only the macaw image was generated with BigGAN, all others were generated with SIREN.

# Conclusions
 I know this wasn't a very good test of the hypothesis, the models are a bit basic and I didn't spend any time fine tuning/modifying them, the sample size is tiny, photos have different resolutions and the batman one is from a videogame (it was surprisingly difficult to find a "real life" picture instead of comics and drawings). But this was mostly for fun! (and to learn) So it was ok.  
   
Despite the BLEU scores, I actually like the Xception model's predictions better, was specially surprised with "two people are standing on the beach looking at something", that was pretty close!  
You can see they both kind of default to some phrase when they are not sure what's going on, like "young boy is playing with ball" for VGG and "man in [colour] shirt standing in front of/the edge of [thing]" for Xception.  
  
Going back to the original questions that started all this,  
- "can we go from text to image back to test and get good results?", I'd say the answer is no, not yet, at least not with these models. The generated images are more like art than real images, OpenAI has recently released [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), which is far more promissing and might be better for this experiment, but I don't have access to the code yet.
- "can the model understand real life images of that original input phrase better than the ones generated by another network?" Debatable, in this case I'd say yes by a tiny margin.

Thats all! hope you found it interesting, thanks for reading!
